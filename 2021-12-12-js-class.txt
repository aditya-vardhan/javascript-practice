data types / variables
  string - 'aditya', '21', 'true', 'false', "vasanth"
  number - 1, 21
  boolean - true, false (true and false without quotes)
  objects - object is a key value pair closed inside flower brackets, syntax: { key: 'value' }, examples: {"1":"aditya"}, {teegala:"shiva"}, {"teegala":"shiva"} Note:key does not need to be mentioned in quotes
  array - array is a structure which starts and closes with square brackets. syntax: [ value ], examples: [1,5,10], ['sampath', 'aditya'], [{"teegala":"shiva"},{"teegala":"chinni"}]
Note: objects and arrays can be designed into complex structures depending on requirement. example: [{ name: 'vasanth', city: 'nzb', marks:[20, 22, 25, 11, 0, 12] }]  


declaring and defining variables:

declaring: let x;
defining: x = 12;
declare and define at same time let x = 12;
Note: declaration can be done only once. Defining can be done multiple i.e time. Means a variable can be re-defined/assigned with different value.


 arithmatic operators:
 addition: +
 subtraction: -
 multiplication: *
 division quotient: /
 division reminder: % 
 
 conditional operators in javascript:
  (is equals)   === 
  (is greater than or equals)  <=
  (is less than or equals)  >=
  (is greater than )  >
  (is less than)  <
 
javascript conditional statements:
Conditional statements are piece/block of code which will be executed on meeting the condition. 1: if, 2: if else, 3: if else if chain, 4: switch
example: let x = 5; let y = 5;
          if(x === y) {
            console.log('x and y are equal')
          }


javascript functions/methods:
A function/method is a block of code designed to perform a re-usable task.
A function can be created in multiple ways:
  way 1:
  let x = (a, b) => {
    return a+b;
  }

  way 2:
  function x(a,b) {
    return a+b;
  }
 If we call the above function. let y = x(5, 7) then the value of variable y will be 12. here 5 and 7 are called parameters passed to the function x.
 console.log() is an inbuilt javascript function. It will write parameters passed. Example: console.log('aditya') statement will print value 'aditya' to the console
